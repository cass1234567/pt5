<h1> CHRISTMAS LETTER </h1>

<h2> Dear mama,<br>
As the holiday season draws near, I wanted to take a moment to write you this letter to share my love and gratitude for everything you do for our family. Christmas has always been a special time for us, filled with love, laughter, and joy.</h2>

<h2> I cherish so many memories of us decorating the tree together, baking cookies, and singing carols by the fireplace. Those moments with you are what make Christmas so magical for me. Thank you for always being there for me, for your unwavering support and unconditional love.</h2>

<h2> You truly are the heart and soul of our family, and I feel so lucky to have you as my mama. Your kindness, strength, and resilience inspire me every day, and Iâ€™m grateful to call you my mom. This Christmas, I want to give you the gift of my love and appreciation.</h2>

<h2> You deserve the world, but for now, please accept this letter as a small token of my gratitude. I hope this holiday season brings you peace, joy, and happiness, and that we can create even more beautiful memories together. Merry Christmas, Mama.</h2>

<h2> I love you more than words can say. With all my heart,<br> Cass </h2>
